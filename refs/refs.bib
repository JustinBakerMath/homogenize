	abstract = {The following paper is reproduced from a Russian journal of the character of our own Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Comptes Rendus (Doklady) de l'Acad{\'e}mie des Sciences de l'{URSS}, 1942, Volume {XXXVII}, No. 7-8. The author is one of the most distinguished of Russian mathematicians. He has made very important contributions in pure mathematics in the theory of functional analysis, and has made equally important contributions to applied mathematics in numerical analysis and the theory and practice of computation. Although his exposition in this paper is quite terse and couched in mathematical language which may be difficult for some readers of Management Science to follow, it is thought that this presentation will: (1) make available to American readers generally an important work in the field of linear programming, (2) provide an indication of the type of analytic work which has been done and is being done in connection with rational planning in Russia, (3) through the specific examples mentioned indicate the types of interpretation which the Russians have made of the abstract mathematics (for example, the potential and field interpretations adduced in this country recently by W. Prager were anticipated in this paper).},

The goal of this course is to review the necessary mathematical tools of homogenization theory and apply them to topology optimization of mechanical structures. The ultimate application, targeted in this course, is the topology optimization of structures built with lattice materials. Practical and numerical exercises are given, based on the finite element free software {FreeFem}++.},

@book{cherkaev_variational_2000,
	abstract = {In recent decades, it has become possible to turn the design process into computer algorithms. By applying different computer oriented methods the topology and shape of structures can be optimized and thus designs systematically improved. These possibilities have stimulated an interest in the mathematical foundations of structural optimization. The challenge of this book is to bridge a gap between a rigorous mathematical approach to variational problems and the practical use of algorithms of structural optimization in engineering applications. The foundations of structural optimization are presented in a sufficiently simple form to make them available for practical use and to allow their critical appraisal for improving and adapting these results to specific models. Special attention is to pay to the description of optimal structures of composites; to deal with this problem, novel mathematical methods of nonconvex calculus of variation are developed. The exposition is accompanied by examples.},

@article{peyre_computational_2020,
	abstract = {Optimal transport ({OT}) theory can be informally described using the words of the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in {OT} cast that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a "global" cost to every such transport, using the "local" consideration of how much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years have witnessed the spread of {OT} in several fields, thanks to the emergence of approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, {OT} is being increasingly used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book reviews {OT} with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of {OT} that make it particularly useful for some of these applications.},
